Gun Duel
========
Original idea is from [Codegolf Stackexchange](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/104896/the-futuristic-gun-duel). The basic rules are as follows.
> **In general:**
Each player starts with an unloaded gun that can load an infinite amount of bullets.
Each turn, players will choose from one of the following actions simultaneously:
 - load a bullet into the gun (-1 ammo)
 - fire a bullet from the gun (+1 ammo)
 - defend an incoming bullet (+/- 0 ammo)

No bullet can be fired from an empty gun. If both players choose the action fire in the same turn no one will be hit and the duel continues.

**Loss:**
A player got hit by a bullet.

**Draw:**
No player has been hit after 100 turns.
